### Introduction
We are a team of expert data engineers working in the fast-changing world of AI, especially in the form of Large Language Models (LLMs). 

### Contribution
We created [OgbujiPT](https://github.com/OoriData/OgbujiPT), an open source python toolkit for using self-hosted large language models (LLMs), 
but also with support for full-service such as OpenAI's GPT models. 

### Useful Resources
- We write about the current state of LLMs and AI on [our blog](oori.dev/blog).
